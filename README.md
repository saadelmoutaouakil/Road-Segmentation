# Road Segmentation Project

## Abstact 
In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks have seen a lot of development, which has enabled the achievement of highly performing segmentation models. In this
paper, we will present our work on the different approaches and models we implemented to efficiently tackle the Road Segmentation challenge on AICrowd. All models are compared based on a given test set, and their accuracies are tabulated.We have obtained a 0.920 F1-Score using a DeepLabV3-ResNet101 architecture and data augmentation techniques implemented specifically for data segmentation problems.



## Requirements
To run the code you need to download on the root of the project our models from the above link :
